# 1vs1 Fighting Game

In this project OOP abstraction topics i covered the most was:
+ Classes and instances
+ Inheriting
+ "this" mechanics
+ Object collisions

But also i have a nice touch of 2d canvas and basic sprites animation(Run, Attack, Jump, Death).
In future i would like to add more GUI features like 'Start/Restart button' together with sound effects and background music.

Feel free to grab your friend and give this game a with [LIVE DEMO](https://cymmgithub.github.io/1vs1---fighting-game/) !
