# 1vs1 Fighting Game

In this project OOP abstraction topics i covered the most was:
+ Classes and instances
+ Inheriting
+ "this" mechanics
+ Object collisions

But also i have a nice touch of 2d canvas and basic sprites animation.
Feel free to give this game a shot with you friend in [LIVE DEMO](https://cymmgithub.github.io/1vs1---fighting-game/)
