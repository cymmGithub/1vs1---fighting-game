# 1vs1 Fighting Game

#### In this project I practiced my OOP abstraction, topics i covered the most was:
+ Classes and instances
+ Inheriting
+ "this" mechanics
+ Object collisions

But also i have a nice touch of 2d canvas and basic sprites animation(Run, Attack, Jump, Death).

#### In future i would like to add: 
+ more GUI features like 'Start/Restart button' 
+ sound effects
+ background music
+ some kind of special attack for each sprite.

Feel free to grab your friend and give this game a with [LIVE DEMO](https://cymmgithub.github.io/1vs1---fighting-game/) !
